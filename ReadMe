Median filtering is a nonlinear digital filtering technique that is often used to remove noise
from a data set. Noise reduction is usually a pre-processing step to that improves or “cleans”
the data in preparation for later processing. In this method, a median filter slides over the data
item by item, generating a new data set, where each item is replaced by the median of
neighbouring entries.
